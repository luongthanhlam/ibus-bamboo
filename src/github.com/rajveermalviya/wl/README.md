# wl

A wayland protocol implementation in pure Go.

This is a Go implementation of the Wayland protocol. The protocol
files themselves (`client.go` and `xdg/shell.go`) are built using the
tool in `github.com/rajveermalviya/wl-scanner` from the XML protocol
specification files.

This is a hobby project, forked from a hobby project, `github.com/dkolbly/wl`.
